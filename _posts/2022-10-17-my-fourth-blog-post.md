# EDA

# Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis is a set of techniques to examine the data before building a model.Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is used to take insights from the data. Data Scientists and Analysts try to find different patterns, relations, and anomalies in the data using some statistical graphs and other visualization techniques
# Strategy to use for EDA
1. Get maximum insights from a data set.
2. Uncover underlying structure.
3. Extract important variables from the dataset.
4. Detect outliers and anomalies(if any).
5. Determine the optimal factor settings

The Goal of EDA is to draw inferences from the data.The strategy to use is to 
- Import the data in a dataset. Create your variables
- Find the missing values
- Determine if the missing values are actually missing or can be filled by some assumptions
- Determine the relationships betweeen various variables.
- Asking Analytical Questions and Visualizations  and do the neccessary summarizations/Calculations
- Create a null hypothesis if needed.
- Draw inferences based on the data visualizations
