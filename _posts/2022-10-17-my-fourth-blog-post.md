# EDA

# Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis is a set of techniques to examine the data before building a model.Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is used to take insights from the data. Data Scientists and Analysts try to find different patterns, relations, and anomalies in the data using some statistical graphs and other visualization techniques
# Strategy to use for EDA
## Get maximum insights from a data set.
## Uncover underlying structure.
## Extract important variables from the dataset.
## Detect outliers and anomalies(if any).
## Determine the optimal factor settings

The Goal of EDA is to dras inferences from the data.
The strategy to use is to 
## Iimport the data in a dataset. Create you variables
## Find the missing values
## Determine if the missing values are actually missing or can be filled by some assumptions
## Determine the relationships betweeen various variables.
## Asking Analytical Questions and Visualizations  and do the neccessary summarizations/Calculations
## create a null hypothesis if needed.
## Draw inferences based on the data visualizations


# Learnings
We learnt to create custom fuunction. We also learnt to create wrapper functions. We used a lot of inbuilt R functions to manipulate data. One of the key to creating plots was to assign a class to a data frame.
We also learnt how to read a file in a fucntion and also how to pass variables as arguments to a function.
# What you would do differently
A lot of manipulation could be done using different functions. I  could have seperated the state and county data while reading the csv file. I could have used a different function to format a particular variable. The plots could have been of different kind
