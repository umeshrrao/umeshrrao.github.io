# Purpose of the Project
The purpose of the project was to learn about functions. In this project we created multiple functions, which involved reading enrollment data for different states and counties.The data was in csv files. we used read_csv function to in the data in a tibble.
The data from different files was combines and a graph was plotted using ggplot to plot statistics by year for different counties and states.
# Learnings
We learnt to create custom fuunction. We also learnt to create wrapper functions. We used a lot of inbuilt R functions to manipulate data. One of the key to creating plots was to assign a class to a data frame.
We also learnt how to read a file in a fucntion and also how to pass variables as arguments to a function.
# What you would do differently
A lot of manipulation could be done using different functions. I  could have seperated the state and county data while reading the csv file. I could have used a different function to format a particular variable. The plots could have been of different kind
