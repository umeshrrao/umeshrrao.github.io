# Online news Popularity
The purpose of the project was to collaborate to  read in and analyze an online news popularity data set.We had to subset the data by data_channel_is_* (one of six groups). We then summarized the data and  predicted the number of shares using predictive models. We also created a lot of summarization graphs
# what would you do differently?
We counld have created custom functions to do the automations instead of using the params feature of the markdown.
# what was the most difficult part for you?
The most difficult part was to figure out the predictor variables as the data set had a lot of variables. After doing some collinearity analysis we were able to figure out some variables which had weight on predicting the no.of shares
# what are your big take-aways from this project?
The main takeaway for me is that we learnt how to choose the predictors and how the different models differed from each other
