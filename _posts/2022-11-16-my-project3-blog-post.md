# online news Popularity
The purpose of the project was to collaborate to  read in and analyze an online news popularity data set.we had to subset the data by data_channel_is_* (one of six groups). We then summarized the data and  predicted the number of shares using predictive models.
# Learnings
We created custom functions to which we can pass a variety of arguments to pull the required data. It was challenging to decide what data to pull as we could have done multiple parameter queries. We finalized our data by doing different queries and anlyzing what it returned.We finalized on recipe and the respective nutrition content.
# What we could do differently
We could have compared the data from different cuisines and could have done nutrient anlysis. Alternately we could have listed all the recipes which have a lower sugar content.
